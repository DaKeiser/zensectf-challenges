We people at Zense are planning to screen the series Mr Robot. We want it to be screened today itself. 
We are to blame we didn't get the permission from Chetan Parikh in time. Can you help us screen Mr.Robot it today itself?
But how do we get permission for opening the room? Getting the keys isn't enough this time:/
