# We wanna watch Mr.Robot!

### Author: SamaVerse

We people at Zense are planning to screen the series Mr Robot. We want it to be screened today itself. We are at blame. We didn't get the permission from Prof. Chetan Parikh in time. Can you help us screen Mr.Robot it today itself? But how do we get permission for opening the room? Getting the key for the room isn't enough this time as guards are always around Acad. block for checks :/
