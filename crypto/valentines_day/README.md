# Valentine's Day

### Author: Hem_C

Valentine's Day is just around the corner! As you are a̶ ̶t̶e̶r̶r̶i̶b̶l̶e̶ ̶p̶e̶r̶s̶o̶n̶ socially responsible, you decide to police couples in campus and publicly shame them. You know, the Buzzrang Dal stuff that gets planned every year but mysteriously never happens.

It's the night of Feb 13. You are going around campus without stopping in order to make sure that nobody plans any midnight surprises. Suddenly you see a guy run from Bhaskara to Leelavati, and when you look across there's a girl waiting for him. Of course there's no way you're going to allow that! 

You shove into him before he makes it and snatch the paper he's holding right out of his hands. Of course they both protest but you greedily eye it hoping to find something incriminating. But it's just a bunch of gibberish! He tells you that it is about studies only but of course you don't buy it no matter how many times they tell you that. Then he smugly tells you "It's fine, you're not going to understand what it means anyways. It's perfectly secure".

Intrigued, you go back to your room to understand what he meant. Then on doing some research you get -
"One Time Pad is an encryption technique which is mathematically proven to be perfectly secure. As in, it leaks 0 information whatsoever about what the original plaintext is. "

The paper has this written on it in the first line:

Here is the flag you want:
