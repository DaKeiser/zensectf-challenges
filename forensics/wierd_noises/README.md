### Author: keiser

On opening your laptop after a hectic day, you decided to watch a TV show. But the audio was gone, instead it was replaced by some recurring loop of noises. You have extracted one iteration of loop for analysis. Download the audio to analyse it. 

**CAUTION**: It's recommended to turn down the volume as this audio file is kind of irritating to hear.
