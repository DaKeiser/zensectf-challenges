# Magician's Signature Format

### Author: keiser

During Infin8, our SAC had invited a *magician* for a performance on campus and you really loved it. After the show you went and asked him for his *signature*. He sent you an email of his signature, as he thought it was tech-savvy. On opening the mail you find the corrupted image which is given below.
After cursing him a million times, being the hacker you are, you decide to fix the corrupted bytes in the image to recover the signature.
