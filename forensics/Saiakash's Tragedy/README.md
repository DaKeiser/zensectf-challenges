# Saiakash's Tragedy

### Author: keiser

Saiakash had just finished his assignment and opened his WhatsApp to see that Ayush Sawlani and entire IMT18 were spamming in the class group. It was a long time since Saiakash was a part of the spam so he decided to spam by making memes. After sometime he realises that assignment deadline was 1 hr to go. He was unable to find the assignment file. The last time he remembered it was in the memes folder. He did some awkward stuff with the memes folder and zipped it, and forgot what he did. He comes rushing to you for help. Help him to recover the assignment file.
