The college has installed security cameras in the campus. Being a hacker, you decide that this would be a nice attack surface and after getting the exact camera model details you download the firmware(_challenge.zip_) running on this device. You poke around a bit and find a critical vulnerability.

Once you recovering password from the firmware, ssh into the camera server to recover the flag using this password.

`ssh camera@chal.zense.co.in -p 6968`
