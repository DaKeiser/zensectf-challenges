### PRO MAFS

Mr. Succ claims to be the next 'human computer' for he can calculate huge multiplications in immesurable time. He built this website and says he'll give you the flag if you beat his time in multiplying numbers. Time to get to the source of this problem.

### MR ROBOTS.TXT

Hello, friend. There's a powerful group of people out there that are secretly running the world. I'm talking about the guys no one knows about, the ones that are invisible. The top 1% of the top 1%, the guys that play God without permission. Don't let them crawl your secrets.

### FREE FLAGS

Prof. Chetan Parikh assigned you with a job to buy new iiitb flags(the ones they hang on lightpoles every fest). You find this shady looking website on the internet claiming to offer free flags. So of course, you click on it because the money saved on flags is the money that goes directly in supporting your feasts at Hyderabadi Spice.

### SCAM FLAGS

Just like every shady looking website on the internet, the flags site turned out to be a massive scam. They never delivered the flags. The fest is just a few days away and you NEED those flags. Intel has it that the site owner himself has some really good flags that he keeps in his /home. But where in his /home?
